		<p>Hello. this is a personal project. Through the creation of this site, I hope to learn a little bit about what is means to create a website from scratch. I chose to host my website through HTML and CSS because I have always had an interest in using it more. The other aspect is that I think it allows me to have more control over the website building process than using something like Squarespace, Weebly, GoDaddy, or Wix. I think it also cuts down on the clutter. This website is supposed to be a place where I can showcase my writing. In this format this page serves as pure text on the user end, and as a mix of pure text and code on mine. Thank you for visitng the AK Journal. I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>
