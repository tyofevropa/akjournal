		<p>A proper undergraduate analysis of literature can be understood as the union of the three ways of understanding and reading a text. Understanding a work or works aesthetically, critically, and in light of the unfolding body of literary theory will produce an essay which (a) satisfies the requirements of a class (b) enhances the student’s understanding of the texts and (c) produces a new angle by which the work(s) can be understood. To these ends, this essay comprises a comparison of Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex by means of their physical staging and their internal logic, in accordance with the guidelines laid out in Aristotle’s poetics as well as by making use of the commentary provided by Nietzche on the genre of tragedy. An unique angle shall become evident through the conceptualization of Hamlet as a move which ultimately solidifies itself as an early modernist work.</p>
		<p>Aristotle organizes his Poetics such that it can be a means through which one analyzes tragedy. He lists, by order of importance, several integral parts which constitute the make-up of a Greek tragedy. Plot, as its paramount status on his list may suggest, is where Aristotle devotes much of his analysis; however, extensive plot analysis is beyond the purview of this essay. As a student of the 21st century this essay will mostly sideline plot. Its function will play a minor role in the analysis.</p>
		<h3>Setting and Staging</h3>
		<p>The contrast of the staging of these two plays is the first glimpse into the drastically different functions within their respective time periods. The staging of Oedipus Rex is in accordance with the traditions of the Ancient Greek theatre; the action happens on a stage with a fixed set. The people look down at the stage upon which “[d]ouble doors dominate the façade; a stone altar stands at the center of the stage” (Sophocles 159). This stone altar places the gods in a position of central importance in the play––this will become important later in the analysis. For now this should just be understood as a comprehensive move, which showcases Sophocles’s attention to detail. There is also the element which Nietzsche identifies as integral to the staging of the play: the Chorus. This chorus blends the audience and the stage into one holistic experience. These elements together gave rise to Nietzsche’s concept of Dionysian ecstasy, which is the “dissolution of the individual and his unification with primordial existence” (Nietzsche 69).</p>
		<p>Between Oedipus Rex and Hamlet a massive gap in time is responsible for many changes to the standards of theatrical productions. While the action remains upon the stage, shifts in scenery upon the stage transport the audience between various locations. The primary locations are the following: inside the castle, outside the castle, and near the sea. The element of chorus has been discarded––this initially suggests that the possibility for the dissolution of the individual self is lost. This is not the case, as will be shown later. It is this very mechanism of staging which transfigures the mechanism of Ancient Greek tragedy. The Dionysian catharsis, or letting go of the self is still achievable without the chorus.</p>
		<h3>Character</h3>
		<p>Oedipus can be understood as a character caught in the web of several competing forces. Philia, eros, and polis, and ultimately theos are these forces. The apical status of theos is evinced by the aforementioned staging; wherein the altar to the gods is placed in the center of things, as well as its looming omnipresence above the doors. Oedipus is a confident man of action. His perspective is gleaned through what he does on stage; given his authority as a king, his word would often constitute a speech act.</p>
		<p>Nietzsche himself noted that Hamlet can be seen as a Dionysian figure. Hamlet has “seen into the true nature of things, —[he has] perceived, but [he is] loath to act; for [his] action cannot change the eternal nature of things; [he] regards it as shameful or ridiculous that one should require of [him] to set aright the time which is out of joint” (Nietzsche 61). This reveals Hamlet as being someone who is loath to act in many instances. While one could read Hamlet’s inaction to be a result of his deep understanding of nuance, his conceptualization of nuance in the first place reveals him to be a man of intellect.</p>
		<p>Another paradigm shift move that Shakespeare makes is the removal of God from the web of competing forces. Whereas Oedipus has all the pull of eros, philia, polis, and theos, Shakespeare leaves out the theos element. This leaves the action of the play to be a pure expression of interactions between mere men. Removing God from the pyramidal structure is a move which is only available to the early modernist period. Hegel who is also a part of this period understands that this move is reflective of a shift towards immortality as it is found in the construction of the State.</p>
		<h3>Plot</h3>
		<p>The most important distinction between the plots of these two plays rests in the difference in their initial degree of certainty. While Oedipus begins from a position of absolute certainty, Hamlet is uncertain. Oedipus is certain that he can solve the murder mystery and save his city. Hamlet by contrast is uncertain about the circumstances surrounding his father’s death. These circumstances invoke the iconic line in which the Ghost call for revenge in the wake of “his foul and most unnatural murder” (Shakespeare 57). This is one of the first moves Shakespeare makes which is quintessentially modernist; it is in Hamlet’s uncertainty that shades of modernism can be seen.</p>
		<p>Oedipus Rex stands in the unique position of having two plots which contrast Oedipus the person with Oedipus the person. This is reflected in the title itself which is a juxtaposition of Oedipus’s name and his title.</p>
		<h3>Thought</h3>
		<p>Shakespeare demonstrates his understanding of the human tendency to find human traits in non-human objects. This tendency is referred to as pareidolia. When Hamlet seeks to demonstrate his madness to Polonius he mentions seeing a camel in the sky. This is relevant because the staging of Hamlet is, in itself, a pareidolic expression of the human mind on display for the audience to see. Herein is the heart of the analysis, because thought––which Aristotle outlines as the mechanism by which the author tells the audience “what is possible and pertinent in given circumstances”––is Shakespeare’s means of achieving the Dionysian dissolution of the self (Aristotle 10) . Hamlet is a recursive exposition of the inner mechanisms of the mind. Hamlet himself has the uniquely Shakespearean habit of delivering monologues to the audience. These monologues offer the audience an insight into the way that Hamlet is thinking. They are an expression of intellectualism since “Man who does not manage to satisfy himself through Action in and for the World in which he lives flees from this World and takes refuge in his abstract intelligence” (Kojève 72). Nietzsche pointed out Hamlet's aversion to action, and so Hamlet becomes a man of greater and greater depths of reflection.</p>
		<p>Yet, it is still only through the means of language itself that his message reaches the ears of the listeners. It must cross the proverbial lawless sea and undergo interpretation on the part of the audience. Therefore, Shakespeare is modeling this in every aspect of his work. The mind is mirrored intentionally by the staging of the play: the inner castle is the most vulnerable element of the mind. It is no coincidence then that the fringe edge of the play is the open sea. Water symbolically a symbol of reflection, it is in water that we see ourselves and are reminded of ourselves.</p>
		<p>Then, the arrival of Fortinbras at the very end of the play has interesting implications. It suggests that the work itself is now being passed off to the people; Shakespeare’s work is now a concept in the minds of all of his audience. He has shown the mind of Hamlet and of the play, and now the audience has crossed the boundary and achieved their dissolution.</p>
		<h3>Culture</h3>
		<p>Lastly, it is important to mention the importance of the cultural aspect which produced all of these works; Hamlet and Oedipus Rex are the primary choices, but Poetics and The Birth of Tragedy, are two more works which require brief inquiry. Nietzche posits that Aristotle was too far removed from the ethosphere under which the Ancient Greek tragedy was conceived to accurately produce a prescription with total accuracy. Nietzsche then claims that the missing element here is the cultural facet. Hamlet therefore is a work which is best understood in terms of the contemporaries who would have existed in temporal proximity to its inception. Nietzsche’s book, which challenged Aristotle for the first time in centuries, came at a point which was ripe for many brilliant minds to enter the world stage.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Hamlet is a spiritual successor to Oedipus insofar as every tragic figure is a spiritual successor. While Shakespeare’s work cannot rival anything that was created during the height of the period during which Ancient Greek tragedies were created, it need not aspire to this measure in the first place. Hamlet exists in a place of early modernism. Nietzsche’s conceptualization of the importance of culture as a shaping mechanism of tragedy applies to Shakespeare as well. It stands to reason that the means by which the Dionysian dissolution might be achieved would exist in a different capacity for the English in the 1600s than for the Ancient Greeks. This does not imply a refutation of the Greek tragedians, but rather another step in“the progressive unfolding of truth” (Hegel 2).</p>
		<p>Therefore, in comparing these two plays we understand the cultural changes across time and light by which anything is known grows and changes. Hamlet, then, occupies a space which is uniquely important for his time. The analysis reveals the changes in context which produce both these characters. The critical analyses which give commentary on the works provide further insight. The synthesis of these things together, combined with the light of the present day understanding gives rise to new thought. Therefore I say that Hamlet is no Oedipus and Oedipa Maas is no Hamlet; but we may be closer to the former than the latter.</p>
