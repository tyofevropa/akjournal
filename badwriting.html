    <h1>On Bad Writing</h1>
	<h6>Uploaded: 18 Oct 2022 :: Last Updated: 26 Oct 2022</h6>
  <body>
	<p>(an excerpt from the upcoming Mind Prism novel)</p>
    <p>In his spare time he write. Honestly, it is less of a hobby and more of a compulsion. Any family member could recount how often he would declare that he was writing ‘a new novel,’ only to drop the concept entirely a few days later. Surely, any one reading this likely shares this sentiment. Recently, yet again, in the interest of reinvigorating the spirit of childhood excitement, he has been writing a novel.</p>
    <p>At the outset of his novel, in order to make the process of writing as seamless and pressure free as possible, he set his intention for the ‘goal’ of this novel: write the worst novel possible. Now, he is several weeks into writing this piece. A puzzling issue has stalled his progress. He wishes to understand what inherently makes something bad. Tho he cannot be sure, he thinks it has to do with intentionality.</p> 
    <p>At the outset, he developed a thought experiment to test his hypothesis. In a series of off-the-cuff text messages to his friend, he detailed the following:</p>
    <p>“Imagine two finished novels. The first novel is written by The Idiot and the second is written by The Pseud (the pseudointellectual). The Idiot completes his 50,000 word manuscript. Yet, what is contained w/in it ? A slurry (for it is nearly is) of grammatical errors, typos, word misuasge, and syntax errors. The manuscript is like this because The Idiot is just that. However, he is a persistent idiot––insofar as he had the wherew/al to complete a 50,000 word work of writing––but an idiot notw/standing. He has seen through to conclusion a work which bears a fragmented, internally inconsistent plot, as well as characters who contradict themselves, dialogue which breaks off and is unclear, and many more facets which make the reading process unbearable for any audience. The Idiot’s goal was simply to craft and tell a story, but due to his idiocy has scarely strewn anything together beyond a series of discursive words. For the purposes of this writing, he shall say the The Idiot possesses no capacity for subversion of expectations, nor do they have any ulterior motive which prompts their abhorrent writing. The Idiot simply lacks the formal education to create a work that is digestible to the public.</p>
    <p>“Now, The Pseud has also written a novel that is nearly identical. The difference being the intention behind it. The Pseud desired to create a ‘bad’ book. To that end they’ve done nearly all the same things that The Idiot did in his book. Sentence run on, they are incomplete, he uses words that don’t exist in any dictionary. The Pseud has written some elementary works which have been conventionally been praised as good works of academic prose. Perhaps they have even won awards. But now The Pseud takes on this creative endeavor. In this latest novel, The Pseud have taken it upon themselves to write a bad novel on purpose.</p>
    <p>“How do both of these works classify as art ? he wonders. This analysis will begin w/ the first novel, written by The Idiot. He asks, ‘what merit does this novel have ?’ What ways can one approach a work of art ? This is not a new question, the history of art criticism has taken on many forms. There are, among others: the aesthetics approach, the new criticism, formalism, feminism, marxism, reader-response, psychoanalytical, biographical, and sociological approaches etc.</p>
    <p>It is his suspicion that this novel bears at least something. It is a product of the circumstances that lead to its inception and creation. The novel tells something about the past by giving insight into the life of someone who lived and wrote a novel. Perhaps this merely constitutes an anthropological and/or psychological approach to the work. He remains agnostic about whether or not these sorts of approaches to looking at the work are enough to classify it as art. One can look at the two pieces from their intentions and this highlights the main contrasting points between the two works.</p>
    <p>The goals and outcomes of the two projects are vastly different. The Idiot has not accomplished his personal goal of writing a good story. His intention was to write a story which would be appreciated by others and bring forth the idea in his mind into a tangible readible object. By almost all metrics he has failed to accomplish this goal. Yet he has still done something; he has made an attempt. It seems then that since his goal was not reached, the amount of time worth giving his novel ought to be close to nothing.</p>
    <p>The Pseud has essentially accomplished his goal. He has written something inscrutable and dense in accordance w/ the type of novel he wanted to write. By accomplishing his goal has he then written something good ?</p<
    <p>And what then of the person who sets out to write something good and it turns out bad ? The goal has not been accomplished, and so it seems we ought to discard this work as well. And yet this seems entirely absurd to suggest. Emily Dickinson did not intend for her poems to be published as complete works, so the mode by which the student approaches her work is tangled up in these issues about the extent to which her works even achieve their goal; of course this is mixed up w/ the fact that she herself did not actually publish the poems, but rather they were published w/out her consent. Still, we do not throw away the mona lisa just because current art scholarship suggests that it remains unfinsihed as it hangs in the Louvre, w/ more than 50% of the canvas lost to time. These works ought not to be thrown out. Somehow, it seems that the author who unintentionally writes something bad is free from criticism in a way the good author who intentionally writes something bad is not.</p>
    <p>He finished his series of texts to his friend by asking what it means to criticise The Pseud’s work. What meaningful critique can be offered for or against the author’s bad novel ? If one decides the novel is bad, the author has achieved their goal, and thus it is ‘good’ insofar as it has achieved its goal. But, if the novel is good, (ie, interesting) then it has failed its goal and is bad. This begs the question whether the extent to which a piece of art achieves the artists goal determines its goodness. This cannot be so, as it seems to result this paradox of good things being bad and bad things being good.</p>
    <p>His friend’s response to this series of texts was mostly mild curiosity. He commented only one text message in response to his rant and gave me another point to consider: it is commonly accepted that authors are not always consciously aware of all the thematic elements and other plot points that emerge on for readers. That is to say, scholarship on a given novel will produce insights beyond the original scope of the author. It is conceivable then, that The Idiot’s bad novel one shall be deemed brilliant by a future society.</p>
    <p>So, what then to make of this ? Is there an objective metric by which to judge these novel to resolve this dilemma ? If he were to write an essay, shouldering the ideas of each of the aforementioned criticism styles, would he reach his conclusion, or would he simply add to the body of discourse ? What would it mean for the bad novel if it were to include this very essay on bad writing ?</p>
